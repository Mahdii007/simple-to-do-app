Title: ðŸš€ Simple To-Do App Using React Hooks! ðŸ“‹âœ¨

Description:

I'm thrilled to share my latest project: a simple and functional To-Do App built using React Hooks and Material UI! ðŸŽ‰

In this project, I focused on creating a user-friendly interface where users can easily manage their tasks. The app allows users to:

Add new tasks with ease.
Edit existing tasks to keep their lists up-to-date.
Delete tasks when they're completed or no longer needed.
Key Features:
React Hooks: Utilized hooks like useState and useEffect for efficient state management.
Material UI: Implemented Material UI components to achieve a sleek and modern look.
Responsive Design: Ensured the app is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Check out the video demonstration of my project, and feel free to share your thoughts or feedback. Iâ€™m always eager to learn and improve!

Thank you for taking the time to view my work! ðŸ˜Š


# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
